## Day 3 - Wednesday 29/11/2017
Another day has come, it's 5:19 AM. Clean face: check. Brush teeth: check. Coffee: check. Time to continue this project. 
The first three days went well, except for the footer of the page whom I want to improve. Remember, I can't modify the index.html file of the project, not even in the slightest. 
In the mentioned document I noticed that the "Resources" and "Archives" divs are both part of the same block like the following simple representation: 

```html
<aside class="sidebar>
    
    <!-- "Select a Design" -->
    <div class="design-selection></div> 
    
    <!-- "Archives" -->
    <div class="design-archives></div> 
    
    <!-- "Resources" -->
    <div class="zen-resources></div> 
    
</aside>
```

Now I am going to put things into order and edit the design as needed. Let's do it. 

Project goal for today:
* fix html order
* modify current design as needed 
* finish the page's design
* ask for feedback

Let's do it!

...

I asked for feedback on Slack and I was pleased to receive good critic despite the early hour. 

So it seems the bottom of the website, from "Benefits" till the end is not - as I suspected - designed well as it doesn't match the upper-half theme. Let's make it more delicious then! 


Here it is
