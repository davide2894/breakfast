# Goal
This project is my humble attempt at the omonym challenge. The interesting part is that the website has the same html, each version is made by customizing only the CSS file!

This is the first time I share a project while I am working at it. I guess it's a good learning opportunity for everyone. #
Expect daily updates with progress report.

## Tools used 
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io): text editor
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com): task-automation. 
* [official index.html](http://www.csszengarden.com), not to be edited
* [MockFlow](): useful website to build mockups without having to use more complex programs. It's intuitve, no instructions needed :)
