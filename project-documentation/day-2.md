## Day 2 - Monday 27/11/2017
Today is the second day I dedicate to this project. The goal I have is to at least finish the mockup. Let's start.

...

I'm going with the flow though slowly. I wonder if it's the same for professional designers. I lost count of how many times I deleted and created an element of the page. Again and again and again because I was either not satisfied of the outcome or something better came up in my mind. 

Anyway, this is today's work

### Conclusion
I didn't hit my project goal for today i.e. I didn't finish to design the mockup. It took more than expected to be honest. One thing I noticed while working on it was that designing is kinda like programming in terms of energy demands. Creativity works in the same way as stamina, at least for me.
Designers, what do you think?
