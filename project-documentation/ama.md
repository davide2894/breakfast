1``` What will we do in Phase 2 ? What kind of courses or projects are programmed ?```


@blank If you make it into Phase 2, you'll gain access to the full Front-End Nanodegree. You can see what that course will involve by checking out the details on the page here: https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001


2--------------------------------------
```QS: Are multiple Quiz submissions a negative factor when it comes to making it to phase 2?
Eg: Only 2 submissions for a Quiz, vs 5 submissions```


@Réka Csima Multiple quiz submissions with not affect you. As long as you've completed it at least once, you're all good to go.



3------------------------------------------------------
```Is there a kind of comment or statistic or something else before February or if we pass or not will just be communicated with an email?```


@lybhy We don't start the selection process until the first phase has ended in February. Only then do we look through everyone's applications and profiles. Communication afterwards will be done via e-mail :sli

```Hi Paul, Marat; hi everyone! 

So, I was recently contacted (here, on Slack) by the student who got into Scholarship first, and that got rejected afterwards (due to country issue). She was asking me if I could tell her what our course looks like. I pointed her to free courses available on Udacity. 

Then, she was asking about particular projects we're doing.. and I was at a loss - because I wasn't sure if it would be okay to just screen shot the projects - which I didn't do - but I did point her to respective projects' slack channels. 

So, my question is, what we can do to help out those students who are not officially in the Scholarship program, but still have access to Slack and are eager to  learn? Does helping them breaches somehow Udacity's ToS? And if so, what we are not allowed to do?```


Hey Ozana, for this situation I think it would be best to steer clear of being involved in such scenarios. While I believe that everyone should have the right to learn, there are legal restrictions set for this Scholarship program that should be adhered to. If a student has been rolled out of the program, then they should have also been removed from Slack and I would appreciate if you sent me their Slack info. It's a very unpleasant situation, believe I know, but it's something we need to stick to.

```If we pass pharse 2 nanodegree can that help us in future work if we place it in CV? :slightly_smiling_face: ```
@mon33x The career support that Phase 2 scholarship candidates will receive will be the  support that is embedded into all Nanodegree programs that include CV and LinkedIn profile review, GitHub profile reviews, interview prep and job search tips that ensure once you graduate, you’ll be prepared to communicate your newly found skills to employers.  You will also be given a Udacity Professional Profile where you can share the projects you completed in your Nanodegree program.  We also have curated jobs with our various hiring partners.
That said, we also see many jobs being recommended through the community - of course, our students and alumni have a much wider network than Udacity can have on it’s own so we encourage everyone to share tips and career help with each other where they can. 
We really want you to achieve great things with these scholarships, but first let’s concentrate on getting into the second phase, all right?



6------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```another question please, are the projects done would be required to submit someday or this is for us as reference only?```


@A. Nabil The projects you do now are self-grader and for you own reference right now. Once you make it to the second phase, your projects will then be reviewed by the mentors.


7------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```Question - Will student's that are not selected in Phase 2 get a discount if they want to continue the course via subscription method?```
@Bogdan Chiriac There is a possibility of some discount offered to the students in the future, but we don’t know the exact numbers yet. It depends on many factors. But it’s waaay to early to worry about it now - there are still two months left for Phase 1, so let’s all focus on succeeding in this now!


8------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```hen you select people for phase 2 you take in take in consideration if they went to meetups in their country ?```


@Radu Alexandru The meetups that happen are organized by students and for their own benefit. Whether it's to connect with people in the program or to find study buddies, we have very little involvement with Meetups. If you post about them in Slack and on the Forum then it goes towards your activity there, but there aren't extra points awarded for going to Meetup. The people you meet are the points :slightly_smiling_face:




9------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```Hello Udacity staff! :slightly_smiling_face:
Will it be enough to finish this course just in time to be considered to the NanoDegree program?
Or those finished ahead of schedule will have the priority?```


@Eugene There aren't any bonuses to students who complete the course ahead of schedule. Because we know that there are so many people with work schedules and families, we want to keep everything level and fair for all Scholarship participants. :slightly_smiling_face:


10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```What about the fact that some of us work full-time which makes it struggling to manage between job, the challenge and other life activities.....how would that be considered for selection to next phase?```
@A. Nabil We completely understand that our students have full-time work and other life commitments, and we appreciate that this scholarship program will fit into your other responsibilities. In terms of community interaction on the forum and Slack, we encourage you to contribute when you can and works for your schedule. It’s important, but it doesn’t have to take all your time. It’s more about the quality of your contributions and engagement than quantity. Also better if you integrate it in you learning process - ask questions, share ideas, brainstorm, assist people with things that you already know (teaching others is the best way to learn). There are plenty of ways to be active and helpful in the community, so I’m sure you’ll find the right way for you. You still have two months for that



11-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```did you start thinking about who will get to Phase 2 ( do  you have a list or something alike)```
@Radu Alexandru we   recognise   that   everybody   has   their   own   pace   of   learning,   so   to   give   everyone   in   the program   an   equal   chance,   we’ll   start   the   evaluation   and   selection   process   only   after   the   end of   Phase   1,   on   February   6th.   Until   then,   everybody   is   equally   close   to   the   finish   line. :v:


12-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```is there any direction to know how much  i'm close to be selected in next phase ? i'm studding well but also worried always ^_^```


@Ayman Morsy We don't start the selection process until Feb 7th. Don't worry and instead use that energy to do your best


```what if I finished the quizzes and I become less active than before on slack and the froum would that affect my chances to pass to the next stage ?```
@Mostafa shortly: yes. We expect you to be engaged during the entire 3-month period. If you finish the course early, there are still many ways you can stay active and keep contributing to this community: to go over some subjects again, polish your projects, take some Udacity free online courses that interest you, and most importantly - engage with the community and share your knowledge with others who are not finished yet. Contribute to the discussions, become an unofficial mentor, organise local study groups. We know from experience that teaching others is the best way to consolidate your knowledge, so basically, everybody wins. :slightly_smiling_face: _BetterTogether_


13-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------es, there are many very different people in this program - a whole 60k of them! :flushed: They all come from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different levels of knowledge. And that’s why we encourage being engaged in the community so much! Out motto is _BetterTogether_ not just because it sounds good, but because we truly believe that that’s the best and only one to achieve things. So you can always find people who are in the same situation as you.                
As we stressed it many times before, when we say “being active in the community”, we don’t mean just being an expert and teaching others, but also asking for help, sharing thoughts and ideas, implementing the feedback you get and giving constructive feedback to others where you feel confident - that’s the best learning process there is, and that’s also how things work in this industry. Even the most pro developers with years of experience are always ready to ask questions and learn from others - and that’s exactly what we want you to get used to.


14--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a general note, because it seems many people here are concerned about the level of activity that is required from them. The main priority of the program is to learn new skills and to better yourselves according to the goals you’ve also set for yourselves. I personally believe that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it as well.
If any of you have ever lead a study group in school, then you know what I’m talking about. When you help others in the forum or on Slack, don’t see it as a way for you to get points, see it as another method to reinforce what you’ve learned so far. It’s all about the quality of your participation, not the quantity.
Believe us, when you are helpful and proactive, we don’t need any sophisticated data analysis techniques to notice that. Such people just stand out on their own
