Responsiveness is the very last thing to do with this website. As we are now in December, I prefer to finish the course first. Because:
* I want to complete one of the challenge requirements BUT I want to do it with excellence. Not in a rush. This means that I may need additional time to fix/edit quizzes and, highly propable, for the last project
* Once I complete the course I can keep working on my personal projects - this is the main before anything else -   

In other words, this project will be on hold for some time, probably a couple of weeks. I hope to come back at it as soon as I can. Still, completing the course with quality has priority now. 

Thank you for the support given until now! :D
Stay tuned.
