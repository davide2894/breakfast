## Day 10 - Tuesday 05/12/2017

5:33 AM - it's a new day, yes it is! It's early morning, the world is still sleeping. There is total quiet now. 

### Main section
This is the third and last part of the mockup I designed though the longest. It is divided in 5 sub-parts that are the following:
1. So What is This About?
2. Participation
3. Benefits
4. Requirements
5. Footer (including the buiscuits splashing in the milk at the very bottom of the page) 

One by one, let's do this.

### So What is This About? 
The goal is to achieve the following look, as per the mockup:

********************************************************************************************
![day9_0](./images/day9_0.png?raw=true)

Only thing to change is the border as I think it would be better if it would look like a chocolate square.


The work divided in different areas:
* layout
* font
* colors

P.S. Sorry for the short post today, I couldn't stay at the computer all day for personal reasons.
