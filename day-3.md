## Day Three - 28/11/2017
Third day of the prohject. On the first day I basically set up everything I needed, then I started to design the website mockup. The following day I continued this very task knowing that the overall look is getting better. I did half of the page. The goal is the same as yesterday: finish to design the page. Let's go!

The "Participation" and "Benefits" sections can go together as the latter has a particularly short text. Not sure a split screen visualization can be achieved. 

By the way, I found this cool color matcher online named [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/421e15-8fd694-4fb286-b5d6b2-f3f7f0). The color palettes are showed in full screen with the relative hex!

Oh my...things got out hands. The mockup became kawaii //insert schocked face. I started to search for a simple donut icon to insert as background then for a cute cupcake and last thing I know I typed "unicor vomiting rainbow" on Google. Ok. Don't worry: you won't see it on the page.

I just finished the footer. Not satisfied. The general result is ok but this last piece of the puzzle is meh. Need to change that.

Here's the result
